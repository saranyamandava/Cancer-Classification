# Cancer-Classification
The goal of this script is to identify IDC when it is present in otherwise unlabeled histopathology images. 
The dataset consists of 277,524 50x50 pixel RGB digital image patches that were derived from 162 H&E-stained breast histopathology samples. These images are small patches that were extracted from digital images of breast tissue samples. The breast tissue contains many cells but only some of them are cancerous. 
Patches that are labeled "1" contain cells that are characteristic of invasive ductal carcinoma.
